    "In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (`budget_data_1.csv` and `budget_data_2.csv`). Each dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Revenue`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total number of months included in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "* The average change in revenue between months over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "* The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "* The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Financial Analysis\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "Total Months: 25\n",

    "Greatest Decrease in Revenue: Aug-12 ($-652794)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly structured dataset in the future (your boss is going to give you more of these -- so your script has to work for the ones to come). In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.\n",
