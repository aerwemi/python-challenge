    "In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given two sets of poll data (`election_data_1.csv` and `election_data_2.csv`). Each dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total number of votes cast\n",
    "\n",
    "* A complete list of candidates who received votes\n",
    "\n",
    "* The percentage of votes each candidate won\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total number of votes each candidate won\n",
    "\n",
    "* The winner of the election based on popular vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Election Results\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "Total Votes: 620100\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "Rogers: 36.0% (223236)\n",
    "Gomez: 54.0% (334854)\n",
    "Brentwood: 4.0% (24804)\n",
    "Higgins: 6.0% (37206)\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "Winner: Gomez\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final script must be able to handle any such similarly-structured dataset in the future (i.e you have zero intentions of living in this hillbilly town -- so your script needs to work without massive re-writes). In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results."
